#Form Validator<br>
This repository contains the code for a simple Form Validator. The purpose of this mini project is to ensure that form fields are correctly filled out before submission, similar to validation mechanisms used on many websites.<br>

1. Validate form inputs based on predefined rules (e.g., required fields, email format, password strength).<br>
2. Prevent form submission if the entered data does not meet the required standards.<br>
3. Provide real-time feedback to users by highlighting errors and displaying appropriate messages.<br>
<br>
Features<br>

2. Validates email format and password strength.<br>
3. Displays error messages for invalid inputs.<br>
4. Prevents form submission until all fields meet validation criteria.<br>
